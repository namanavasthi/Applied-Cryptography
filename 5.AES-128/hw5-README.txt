Comments on design decisions    : Modularized Code for Better Readability. 
								: GNU getopt was used to parse input arguments. I got knowledge of this library (getopt.h) from the class google group discussion titled “Parsing Arguments” posted by Nick Funk on Feb 3rd. The code used is learnt from the GNU getup page "http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Getopt-Long-Options.html#Getopt-Long-Options"
								: This HW does reuse code from the previous HW (HW4) a lot. The template for hw5.c many of the other functions

Comments on deviation from spec :   The code is as per the spec given in the grading guidelines.
